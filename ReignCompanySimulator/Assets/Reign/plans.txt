make it so the following happens:

- there are companies
    - one-roll company creator
        - one-rolls
- the companies are shown with their values
    - companyController
    - UI

- the companies do company turns
    - turn structure
    - company-turn-command
    - random AI
- company turns are displayed in console via text

wild idea: make this a city simulator god game.
you would influence the context of the companies,
so that they then make decisions in different manners

how to make companies more interesting?
   - make them smarter
        - anything but a random AI sounds awesome
            - could just build different brains for companies, then later throw them all into one pool
            - if-chain
            - state machine
            - behavior tree
   - planning and knowledge
        - blackboard
        - planner AI
   - morale?
   - assets
   - faces
   - history
   - properties
   - company builder like the character journeys in Traveller
        - events
        - decisions
        - accumulating a character sheet
            - stats
            - aspects
