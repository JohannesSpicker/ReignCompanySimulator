//visualize some stats
// build a prefab visualizer for each of: stat, derivedStat, resource
// => probably want to do this via prefabVariants
//and then put them together in an AttributeContainerVisualizer

//so show each of them on their own, then show them together.

//then add functionality to play around with all of them
